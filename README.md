# Medical-ChatBot-BioMistral7B

I build this application using a powerful technologies tailored for the medical domain. I start by introducing BioMistral 7B, a new large language model specifically designed for medical applications, offering unparalleled accuracy and insight into complex medical queries. You can have a view here https://huggingface.co/BioMistral/BioMistral-7B

Next, I delve into Qdrant, a self-hosted vector database that we run inside a Docker container. This robust tool serves as the backbone for managing and retrieving high-dimensional data vectors, such as those generated by our medical language model.

To enhance our model's understanding of medical texts, I utilize PubMed BERT embeddings, an embeddings model specifically crafted for the medical domain. This ensures our application can grasp the nuances of medical literature and queries, providing more precise and relevant answers.

A crucial component of our setup is Llama.cpp, a library that enables the inference of large language models on CPU machines. This quantized model approach allows for efficient and cost-effective deployment without compromising on performance.

For orchestrating our application components, I introduce LangChain, an orchestration framework that seamlessly integrates our tools and services, ensuring smooth operation and scalability.

On the backend, I leverage FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+. Finally, for the web UI, I employ Bootstrap 5.3, the latest version of the worldâ€™s most popular front-end open-source toolkit. This enables us to create a sleek, intuitive, and mobile-responsive user interface that makes our medical RAG application accessible and easy to use.
